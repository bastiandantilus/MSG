**MSG!**

*by Scott Lawrence (theelven@gmail.com)*
A fun little match 3 game in vanilla javascript. 

[Play MSG Now][1]

Match the colors + shapes, or match the numbers! 
Drag one piece to its neighbor's spot to swap. 
If your swap doesn't make a match, you will lose points! 

If you make every match possible, you win! 
If you mess up too many times, you lose. 

The higher your score, the more colors and numbers on the field.
